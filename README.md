#About Me


Name: Asha Anderson
Hometown: Atlanta, Georgia, USA

Prior IT Experience:
I have a strong foundation in IT through academic coursework and hands-on experience. I’ve interned with NASA as a Software Engineering Intern, where I translated legacy MATLAB code to Python and developed a GUI for the S-Band Ground Station. I also participated in a cybersecurity research program at the University of Arizona, where I executed controlled cyber attacks in a virtual environment to better understand real world vulnerabilities. I create websites for indivduals. For example, I made vaxnowga.org to help georgians get informed about covid and to promote getting vaccinated and tested. I also worked with DC medical society creating and app called covid care. The rest of my expereince comes from my coursework at Howard University where I took various classes in computer science, cybersecurity,cloud computing, andrioid development. 
Career Plans:
After completing the cybersecurity course, I aspire to become a cybersecurity analyst or network security engineer. My goal is to work in the defense, healthcare, or tech industry, helping organizations protect their digital assets and maintain secure systems. I’m also passionate about using my skills to advocate for underrepresented communities in tech.

Proud Project/Task:
One project I’m especially proud of was developing the front-end of a web application for Amazon's customer service call center during my senior capstone project. I started by prototyping the interface in Figma, then coded it in JavaScript using AWS Amplify and SurveyJS. Based on user feedback, I redesigned key interface components to improve usability, such as implementing horizontal call displays and integrating timestamps. This project stood out to me because it directly impacted real-world operations and challenged me to merge design thinking with technical implementation.
